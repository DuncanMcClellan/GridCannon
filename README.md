# GridCannon

Overview:

GridCannon is a single player card game that may be played with a regular deck of 52 cards. The point of the game is to eliminate the Royals (Jacks, Queens, & Kings) using a gridcannon, which is constructed out of three cards. (1 card is the trigger, 2 cards are the payload.) This goes into more detail (see below).

Rules of the Game:

Start by laying out the grid of 3x3 cards. Draw cards randomly from deck of 52 cards. If a royal is drawn, it is added to a separate pile. As you add cards to the grid, you skip the middle.
Finally, when the deck is all laid out, it is time to place the royals. Each royal must be placed next to a card that is most similar to it. Royals are placed on the outside of the 3x3 grid.

Now that all the available Royals are placed, the game begins. Remember, you want to eliminate the Royals.

	- Draw a new card, and decide where to put it.
		- Cards can only be placed on top of cards that are lower or equal to the drawn card.
			- Recall that Jokers have no value, so any card may be placed on them.
			- If no spots are available, the card may be placed in the center if it is empty.
		  - If a Royal is drawn, it is placed on the outside of the grid, similar to the previous step.

	- Now when you place a card opposite of a Royal, you hit them with the damage of the two cards in-between the placed card and the Royal. Restrictions apply though.
		- When killing a Jack, the color and suite of the cards do not matter. 
		- When killing a Queen, the color of all three cards must match.
		- When killing a King, the suite of all three cards must match.

	- If you draw a card that cannot be placed anywhere (all other cards have a greater value) you have two options:
		- 1. Hard Reset - Reset one of the stacks. The card you canâ€™t place goes in the shame pile. The stack you select then is added to the bottom of the stack, and the game continues.
		- 2. The card that cannot be placed is added as armor for the Royal most like it. This increases the hit points of the Royal by the value of the card.

	- If you draw an Ace, it has a value of 1, but it may be placed on top of anything.
		- An Ace acts as a reset, so when it gets placed, the cards in the spot will be added to the bottom of the deck. (Joker also acts as a reset.)
		- A reset can still trigger the gridcannon.

	- If all royals on the grid are dead, but there are still some in the deck, keep drawing cards until a royal is found. Then add the cards you turned over to the bottom of the deck.

Additional Details:
	Pile of Shame is a negative score, counts against you at the end of the game.
	Generally, you want triggers to be as low as possible.
